# Ryanet-blog
The blog component for Ryanet.

## What I am using
- Ghost, because I wrote myself a theme the first time I used it and it took me three days.

## What I am trying to do now
- Set it up!
- (Again the Ghost team is making illogical decisions and they expect everyone to use their cli, but I don't like it.)
- (so I am going to start this thing up myself as a node module)

## What is on my todo list
- Set it up!
